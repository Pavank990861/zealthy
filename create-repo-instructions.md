# GitHub Repository Creation Instructions

## Option 1: Create Repository Manually

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Sign in** with your credentials
3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
4. **Select "New repository"**
5. **Fill in the details**:
   - Repository name: `zealthy-onboarding`
   - Description: `Full-stack onboarding flow application with MongoDB Atlas integration`
   - Make it **Public**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if available)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create the repository directly:

```bash
gh auth login
gh repo create zealthy-onboarding --public --description "Full-stack onboarding flow application with MongoDB Atlas integration"
```

## After Creating the Repository

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, run:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Important Notes

- Your GitHub username might be different from your email
- If you get authentication errors, you might need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password
- Make sure the repository name matches exactly: `zealthy-onboarding`

## Troubleshooting

If you get "Repository not found" error:
1. Double-check the repository name
2. Make sure you're signed in to the correct GitHub account
3. Verify the repository was created successfully

If you get authentication errors:
1. You might need to use a Personal Access Token
2. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
3. Generate a new token with repo permissions
4. Use the token as your password when prompted
